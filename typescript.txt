Typescript will work on Class and Object


Class A{
    public void Test()
    {
        sysout("gdjhfjkd")
    }
}

//classname ref = new Constructor();

A a = new A();
a.Test()


what is class - ?

class is a combination of Methods , Object and Constructor

if any thing is missing we cant run the pgm or execute the pgm

what is object

object is a replica of class or blue print of the class


abstract class abstract{
    abstract void test(); //unimplemented
}

class abd extends abstract{
    void test()
    {
        sysout("testionhg)
    }
}

abd a =new abd();
a.test

create 4 class - each class contains 3 methods - 
all method should call and run with the creation of object - test



Inheritance :- Aquaring the properties from other class that is called a Inheritance
we can achieve with the help of extends keyword in typescript and java as well


what is multilevel Inheritance
Step by step Inheritance or we can say generation by genartaion 
transformation is called Multilevel

what is multiple Inheritance

one class want to inherit more than one class at a time - It is 
called multiple Inheritance

can we achieve multiple inheritance in Typescript

No, we can achieve Multiple Inheritance at class level
 but we can achieve at Interface level- it will cover at interface level

what is the major difference in Multiple and Multilevel- 

Consider a scenario where RBIBank is a class that provides a method to get the rate of interest.
 However, the rate of interest may differ according to banks

 SBI - 8
 HDFC - 9 
 ICICI- 10

 RBIBank - roi() --- Inheritance 

 -- currency Pgm - along with country 

 India - Inr
America - dollar
europe - euro --- inheritance


One to Many 
Many to one relation in inheriatnce


function Overloading

Function Over riding

Custtructor - Run polymorphism

Interface 

Data type , for loop and multi function in typescriptiom

Will start the typre script framework with protractor



Functional Overloading 

- Function name should be same 
- the number of parameter is same and type should be different

int a int b  string and string

public void Test(int a , String b)
{

}

public void Test(int a)
{

}

function add( a , b)
{

}
function add (a, b ,c )
{

}

add("java" , "script")

WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver()


Same Methods , same signature different implementation is called a method Over riding
and we can achieve with the help of Inheritance - extends
all condition should be tru - if any one missing we cant achieve Method Over riding

PolyMorphism - Same object behaving different different instace through out 
the execution of the pgm - that is called a polymorphism

run time polymorphism - Method Over riding , Upcasting - if any one is missing you cant achieve
Compile Time Polymorphism - Method Over loading


Type Script

PolyMorphism can we achieve with the help of Method Over riding - that it

Constructor :- 

Constructor name and class name should be same in java 

in typescript is almost same - but if we need to create a constructor -
we have use Constructor keyword in Type script

if user is not declaring any constructor - who will create - 
Compiler will create blank constructor/default constructor in java and Typescript as well

if user declaring any constructor - Compiler never create default or blank Constructor

in java we can create any number of constructor with different parameter
but in typescript - we cant create more than one constructor - it is not possible

gv = Local variable

if user not use this keyword - priority should be local only



Just work on super keyword in Type script - 


This will work for variable --- current class
this will work for method

Super will work for variable -- parent class - and inheritance is compulsory
super will work for method


super constructor and this constructor  should be first statement 

both you cant use at a time
